# Three_Dimensional_Integral_Imaging
•	Collaborated with 3D Imaging and Display Group of University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain
•	Designed an algorithm based on Fourier optics analysis for reconstruction of 3D images using Integral Imaging
•	Analyzed and calculated the deteriorating effects of diffraction on the Field of View, Depth of Field and Resolution of reconstructed 3D images using a 16x16 array of lenses in different imaging modes
